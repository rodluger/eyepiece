TODO
----

- Find bug in ``random/input0004.py``
- Maximum size for bad chunks in detrended plot
- For usps: ensure that data points don't get included in neighboring transits!
- Add ``clobber`` override options to all functions
- Put crowding in ``pysyzygy``
- ``alt`` subtraction not working on Hyak
- When user quits out of interactive inspect, cancel qsub job
- Multi-planet system handling
- Fit parameters simultaneously; beware overlapping transits
- Use Rowe's transit times for TTV systems
- Libralato et al. - K2 PSF photomoetry
- Fabien Bastien: Flicker can give stellar density within ~ 30%
- Resolve tension between ``inject`` and ``trninfo`` in ``DownloadInfo()``

NOTE
----

- I had to edit the matplotlibrc file to set ``Agg`` as the default backend
